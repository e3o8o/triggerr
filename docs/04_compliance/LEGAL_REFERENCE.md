## 3. Regulatory Arbitrage Strategy

### 3.1 Current Arbitrage Position

**Core Strategy**: Exploit regulatory gaps and favorable jurisdictions to minimize compliance burden while maximizing operational flexibility.

#### 3.1.1 Platform vs. Insurer Classification
- **Traditional Approach**: Single entity acting as both platform and insurer
- **Arbitrage Approach**: Platform (Parametrigger) separate from insurer (Triggerr Direct)
- **Advantage**: Platform treated as technology company, not insurance company
- **Regulatory Benefit**: Reduced capital requirements, faster innovation cycles

#### 3.1.2 Parametric vs. Traditional Insurance
- **Traditional Approach**: Subjective claims assessment, regulatory approval for rates
- **Arbitrage Approach**: Objective parametric triggers, algorithmic pricing
- **Advantage**: Surplus lines treatment, reduced regulatory oversight
- **Regulatory Benefit**: No rate approval requirements, faster market entry

#### 3.1.3 Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy
- **Traditional Approach**: Single jurisdiction, full compliance burden
- **Arbitrage Approach**: Optimal jurisdiction for each business function
- **Advantage**: Each entity operates under most favorable regulations
- **Regulatory Benefit**: Minimized compliance costs, maximum operational flexibility

### 3.2 Arbitrage Value Calculation

| Arbitrage Strategy | Annual Savings | Regulatory Runway | Risk Level |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Nevada Incorporation** | $200K-2M | 24 months (sandbox) | Low |
| **Entity Separation** | $500K-1M | Ongoing | Low |
| **Parametric Product Design** | $100K-500K | 18-24 months | Medium |
| **DeFi Integration** | $50K-200K | 12-18 months | Medium |
| **Surplus Lines Approach** | $200K-800K | 12-24 months | Medium |
| **Total Annual Value** | **$1.05M-4.5M** | **12-24 months** | **Medium** |
