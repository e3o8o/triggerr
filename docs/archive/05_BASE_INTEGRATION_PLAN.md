# **Triggerr Base Integration & Architecture Revision Plan**

**Document Version**: 2.1
**Date**: Jul 16, 2025
**Status**: **Approved Architectural Change Blueprint**
**Objective**: To consolidate all strategic decisions, architectural implications, and required document updates for pivoting to Base (with owned smart contracts) as the initial blockchain for Triggerr's MVP, while maintaining a blockchain-agnostic architecture. This document serves as the single source of truth for all subsequent refactoring and documentation tasks.

## **1. Executive Summary: Strategic Pivot to Owned Base Smart Contracts**

The Triggerr platform is undergoing a pivotal architectural shift for its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Instead of relying on PayGo's managed blockchain services as the primary on-chain layer, we will now **develop, deploy, and own our core smart contracts directly on the Base network (an Ethereum Layer 2)**. This strategic decision is driven by:

*   **Long-Term Ownership & Control**: Full intellectual property and governance over our on-chain logic.
*   **Investment Appeal**: Positions Triggerr as a true Web3-native company, appealing to blockchain-focused investors.
*   **Future Multi-Chain Agility**: Leveraging EVM compatibility allows for seamless expansion to other chains (Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum Mainnet, etc.) with minimal code changes, setting the stage for a flexible Triggerr API/SDK.

This pivot does **not** abandon blockchain agnosticism. Our architecture remains designed to support multiple chains via a pluggable `IBlockchainService` interface. Base is simply becoming our *initial default*, with the capacity to switch to PayGo or any other supported chain when desired.

## **2. The New Phase 1.5: Base Integration with Owned Smart Contracts**

This section details the concrete changes required for Base integration. This replaces the previous implicit PayGo reliance in Phase 1.5 tasks.

### **2.1. Scope of Our Custom Base Smart Contracts**

We will develop, test, and deploy the following core Solidity smart contracts on the Base network (and Base Sepolia for testnet):

*   **`TriggerrEscrowFactory.sol` (The Core Factory Contract - for Modular Escrows)**:
    *   **Purpose**: This will be the single, trusted entry point for creating all types of escrows on the Triggerr platform. It acts as a registry and deployer for different escrow logic contracts.
    *   **Core Functions**:
        *   `function createSingleSidedEscrow(...)`: Deploys a simple escrow for user premiums, returning the address of the new escrow proxy contract.
        *   `function createDualSidedEscrow(...)`: Deploys an escrow that handles contributions from both the user and a provider.
        *   *(Future functions for other models, like `createCollateralPoolEscrow`, can be added later)*
    *   **Upgradeability**: The factory itself will be simple and likely immutable. The individual escrow logic contracts it points to will be upgradeable.

*   **Multiple Escrow Logic Implementations (The Primitives - Deployed via Factory)**:
    *   Instead of one giant contract, we will create multiple, simple, and highly audited implementation contracts for each escrow model. For MVP, we will start with the most critical ones:
        *   **`SingleSidedEscrowLogic.sol`**: A minimal contract that holds a user's premium and allows for fulfillment or release.
            *   **Core Functions**: `fulfillEscrow`, `releaseEscrow`, `getEscrowStatus`.
            *   **Improvements**: Standardized Custom Errors, Enhanced Event Logging (as detailed below).
        *   **`DualSidedEscrowLogic.sol`**: A contract that can accept funds from two distinct parties (e.g., user premium and provider collateral) and has logic for their conditional release.
    *   **Proxy Contracts (EIP-1822 / UUPS - Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)**:
        *   **Mechanism**: The `TriggerrEscrowFactory.sol` will not deploy the logic contracts directly. Instead, it will deploy lightweight **proxy contracts**. Each proxy contract is a separate, unique escrow instance that delegates all its calls to a master logic implementation (e.g., `SingleSidedEscrowLogic.sol`).
        *   **Benefit**: This is the key to **long-term maintainability and security**. If we discover a bug or need to add a feature to our escrow logic, we can deploy a new *implementation* contract and upgrade all existing proxy contracts to point to it, **without migrating any funds or changing any escrow addresses**.

*   **`TriggerrPolicyRegistry.sol` (Dedicated Policy Hashing & Verification)**: **REQUIRED CONTRACT**
    *   **Purpose**: To immutably record a cryptographic hash of each `InsurancePolicy` on-chain, providing verifiable proof of policy existence and terms. This contract serves as a public, transparent ledger of policies.
    *   **Core Functions**:
        *   `function registerPolicy(bytes32 policyId, bytes32 policyHash, address policyholder, address provider, uint256 policyEffectiveTimestamp)`: Records the immutable hash of a policy.
        *   `function getPolicyHash(bytes32 policyId) view returns (bytes32)`: Retrieves the recorded hash for a given policy ID.
    *   **Events**: `PolicyRegistered(bytes32 indexed policyId, bytes32 indexed policyHash, address policyholder)`.
    *   **Benefit**: Ensures maximum transparency and auditability of policy terms for users, regulators, and future integrators via the TriggerrAPI/SDK.

*   **`TriggerrDelegation.sol` (Optional: Permissions Management)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To allow our authorized backend or designated oracles to interact with user-controlled funds or policies (e.g., for automated payouts without direct user signing).
    *   **Core Functions**: `setDelegate`, `executeDelegatedAction`.

*   **`PolicyFund.sol` (DeFi Capital Provisioning)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Our main treasury contract, accepting premium deposits (e.g., USDC), immediately supplying them as liquidity to a chosen DeFi lending protocol (e.g., Morpho Blue on Base) to earn yield. It also facilitates secure payouts by withdrawing funds.
    *   **Core Functions**: `depositPremium`, `executePayout` (callable by authorized backend).

*   **`TriggerrFaucet.sol` (Testnet Utility)**:
    *   **Purpose**: A simple contract for dispensing test tokens on Base Sepolia.

### **2.2. Smart Contract Development & Auditing Strategy**

*   **Development**: Requires specialized Solidity development expertise. Focus on security, gas efficiency, and upgradeability (if desired for future versions).
*   **Mandatory Security Audit**: Critical. Before any mainnet deployment, all core smart contracts (`TriggerrEscrowFactory.sol`, `SingleSidedEscrowLogic.sol`, `PolicyFund.sol`, `TriggerrPolicyRegistry.sol`) *must* undergo a professional third-party security audit by a reputable blockchain security firm.
    *   **Timeline Impact**: Adds an estimated **4-6 weeks** to the overall MVP timeline, including remediation time.
    *   **Budget Impact**: Requires a dedicated budget for auditing services.

### **2.3. `@triggerr/base-adapter` Implementation**

*   **New Package**: Will be created within `packages/blockchain/` (e.g., `packages/blockchain/base-adapter`).
*   **Implementation**: This adapter will implement `IBlockchainService`. Its methods (e.g., `createEscrow`, `releaseEscrow`, `getEscrowStatus`) will directly:
    *   Utilize a Web3 library (like **Viem or Ethers.js**) to connect to the Base network.
    *   Construct and encode function calls to our deployed `TriggerrEscrowFactory.sol`, `TriggerrPolicyRegistry.sol`, `PolicyFund.sol`, and `TriggerrDelegation.sol` contracts.
    *   **New Improvements**:
        *   **Explicit Transaction Hashes**: Ensure all methods return standard EVM transaction hashes (`0x...`) in their `TransactionResult` objects.
        *   **Robust Nonce Management**: Implement explicit, reliable nonce management for all outgoing transactions to prevent "missing nonce" or "replacement transaction" errors.
        *   **Gas Estimation Utilities**: Expose utility functions to estimate gas costs for transactions before sending, allowing our backend services to optimize and manage gas budgets.
        *   **Standardized Error Mapping**: Parse custom Solidity errors emitted by our contracts and map them to standardized, Triggerr-specific error codes and messages for consistent handling across our application layer.
    *   Manage transaction signing (for backend-initiated transactions, e.g., payouts, funding the policy fund) using securely stored private keys.
    *   Handle gas estimation and transaction submission, and monitor for transaction confirmations.

## **4. Final Cleanup Plan (Post-Refactor)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

After completing the core refactoring based on the document updates above, the following final cleanup tasks have been executed to ensure a pristine project state.

1.  **Regenerate Lockfiles** ✅ **EXECUTED**
    *   **Action**: Deleted all `bun.lockb` files across the monorepo.
    *   **Command**: `find . -name "bun.lockb" -delete`
    *   **Follow-up**: Ran `bun install` from the root `triggerr` directory to regenerate a clean, consistent lockfile based on the now-correct `package.json` configurations.
    *   **Verification**: Verified no `@insureinnie` scopes remain in the new lockfile.

2.  **Clean Up Stale Build Artifacts** ✅ **EXECUTED**
    *   **Action**: Deleted the stale `triggerr/packages/shared/src/constants/index.js` file and its associated map file.
    *   **Reason**: These were old build artifacts that contained legacy `PRTF` and `InsureInnie` references and were out of sync with the TypeScript source. Our build system now generates correct, up-to-date JS files.

3.  **Align Business Type Definitions** ✅ **EXECUTED**
    *   **Action**: Created auto-generation script and regenerated `triggerr/packages/shared/src/types/business-types.d.ts` from database schema.
    *   **Reason**: The previous interface was misaligned with the actual database schema and contained TypeScript errors.
    *   **Implementation**:
        *   Created `packages/core/scripts/generate-business-types.ts` for automatic type generation
        *   Added `bun run generate:types` command to package.json
        *   Generated correct interfaces matching database schema with proper enum types
        *   Eliminated TypeScript errors and duplicate identifiers
        *   Established single source of truth from `schema.ts` to prevent future drift
