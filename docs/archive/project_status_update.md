# Project triggerr: Foundation Phase Completion & MVP Readiness

**Date:** June 17, 2025
**Status:** Phase E (Better-Auth Middleware Setup) Complete, Ready for Phase F (Anonymous Session Handling)

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the significant achievements in completing the foundational phase for the triggerr MVP. The primary focus has been on establishing a robust database schema, comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and thorough testing mechanisms to support both anonymous and authenticated user flows, particularly for policy purchase and management.

Our efforts have resulted in a clean, consolidated, and validated backend structure, ensuring data integrity, security, and readiness for subsequent development phases.

## 2. Core Achievements

### 2.1. Database Schema Enhancements & Migration

The database schema has been meticulously updated to seamlessly support both anonymous and authenticated user interactions across critical tables.

**Key Table Modifications:**

*   **`policy`**:
    *   Added `anonymous_session_id TEXT NULL` column.
    *   Modified `user_id TEXT` to be nullable.
    *   Implemented `CHECK ((user_id IS NOT NULL) != (anonymous_session_id IS NOT NULL))` to ensure either `user_id` or `anonymous_session_id` is populated, but not both.
    *   Added `INDEX policy_anon_session_idx ON public.policy (anonymous_session_id)`.
*   **`user_wallets`**:
    *   Added `anonymous_session_id TEXT NULL` column.
    *   Modified `user_id TEXT` to be nullable.
    *   Implemented `CHECK ((user_id IS NOT NULL) != (anonymous_session_id IS NOT NULL))`.
    *   Added `INDEX user_wallets_anon_session_idx ON public.user_wallets (anonymous_session_id)`.
*   **`user_payment_methods`**:
    *   Added `anonymous_session_id TEXT NULL` column.
    *   Modified `user_id TEXT` to be nullable.
    *   Implemented `CHECK ((user_id IS NOT NULL) != (anonymous_session_id IS NOT NULL))`.
    *   Added `INDEX user_payment_methods_anon_session_idx ON public.user_payment_methods (anonymous_session_id)`.
*   **`policy_verification_code`**:
    *   Added `anonymous_session_id TEXT NULL` to allow anonymous users to use verification codes if their policy was purchased anonymously.
    *   Added `INDEX policy_verification_code_anon_session_idx ON public.policy_verification_code (anonymous_session_id)`.
*   **`policy_event`**:
    *   Added `anonymous_session_id TEXT NULL` for consistency in tracking events related to anonymously purchased policies.
    *   Added `INDEX policy_event_anon_session_idx ON public.policy_event (anonymous_session_id)`.
*   **`quote_cart_items`**, **`conversations`**, **`conversation_messages`**:
    *   These tables already supported `anonymous_session_id` and nullable `user_id` but were verified to align with the overall strategy.

**Migration Management:**

*   All schema changes were managed using Drizzle ORM.
*   Drizzle migrations (e.g., `0001_tidy_slayback.sql`, `0002_polite_azazel.sql`) were generated to reflect these changes.
*   While some initial changes were applied manually during iterative debugging, the final schema state is consistent with the generated migrations. The database schema is confirmed to be up-to-date.

### 2.2. Row Level Security (RLS) Overhaul

A comprehensive and idempotent RLS policy script (`packages/core/database/RLS_sql.txt`) has been developed and successfully applied. This script ensures robust data security and isolation for all user types.

**Key RLS Policy Features:**

*   **Idempotency**: The script uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ...` for every policy, ensuring it can be rerun safely without errors, overwriting existing policies to maintain consistency.
*   **Anonymous User Policies**:
    *   Access is controlled via `current_setting('app.anonymous_session_id', true)`.
    *   Anonymous users can manage their own `quote_cart_items`, `user_wallets`, `user_payment_methods`, and `conversations`/`conversation_messages`.
    *   Anonymous users can view policies (`policy`, `policy_verification_code`, `policy_event`) associated with their session.
*   **Authenticated User Policies**:
    *   Access is controlled via `auth.uid()::text = user_id` (since `user_id` is `TEXT` and `auth.uid()` returns `uuid`).
    *   Authenticated users can manage their own data across all relevant tables (`quote_cart_items`, `policy`, `user_wallets`, `user_payment_methods`, `conversations`, etc.).
    *   Strict data isolation is enforced, preventing one authenticated user from accessing another's data.
*   **Service Role (`service_role`)**:
    *   Granted full access (`FOR ALL`) to all tables for backend operations, system tasks, and administrative purposes.
*   **Public Read Access**:
    *   Reference data tables (`countries`, `regions`, `airline`, `airport`, `aircraft_types`, `runways`, `routes`, `flight`) are configured for public read access (`USING (true)`).
    *   Active `provider` and `provider_product` (status = 'PUBLISHED') information is publicly viewable.
*   **Policy Corrections & Refinements**:
    *   Resolved issues with incorrect enum value comparisons (e.g., `product_status_enum`).
    *   Corrected column name references (e.g., `is_secret` vs. `is_sensitive` in `system_configuration`).
    *   Simplified `UPDATE` policies' `WITH CHECK` clauses for `user_wallets` and `user_payment_methods` to `WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id)` to avoid persistent `OLD`/`NEW` record context issues in the `psql` execution environment, deferring column-specific update restrictions to application logic or column-level grants if needed.

### 2.3. Test Script Consolidation & Enhancement

The testing strategy was significantly improved by consolidating multiple specific test scripts into two comprehensive, primary test suites. Older, superseded scripts were archived.

*   **`triggerr/scripts/test_anonymous_flow.sql`**:
    *   Provides end-to-end testing for the anonymous user lifecycle.
    *   Includes creation and management of `quote_cart_items`, `policy`, `policy_verification_code`, `user_wallets`, `user_payment_methods`, and `conversations`.
    *   Crucially, validates RLS data isolation by:
        *   Setting `app.anonymous_session_id` to different values.
        *   Executing queries as the `anon` role (`SET ROLE anon;`) to ensure policies are correctly applied from the perspective of an anonymous user.
    *   Checks the schema structure for readiness to migrate anonymous data to an authenticated user state.
*   **`triggerr/scripts/test_authenticated_flow.sql`**:
    *   Provides end-to-end testing for the authenticated user lifecycle.
    *   Includes the creation of test users (using canonical UUIDs).
    *   Covers the same data entities as the anonymous flow, but linked via `user_id`.
    *   Validates RLS data isolation between different authenticated users by:
        *   Using `SET SESSION "request.jwt.claims" = '{"role": "authenticated", "sub": "test-user-uuid"}'` to simulate different user contexts by setting `auth.uid()` and `auth.role()`.
        *   Executing queries as the `authenticated` role (`SET ROLE authenticated;`) to ensure policies are correctly applied.
    *   Uses canonical UUIDs for `test_user_id_1` and `test_user_id_2` for accurate simulation.
    *   Corrected `psql` variable substitution syntax (e.g., `:\'variable_name\'`) and JSON string formatting within SQL `INSERT` statements.
*   **Archival**: Obsolete test scripts (`add_anonymous_to_policy_tables.sql`, `anonymous_implementation_summary.sql`, `test_anonymous_complete.sql`, `test_anonymous_policies.sql`, `update_anonymous_rls.sql`, `update_policy_rls.sql`) were moved to `triggerr/docs/archive/`.

### 2.4. Key Validations & Successes

Through the enhanced RLS policies and comprehensive test scripts, the following critical functionalities and security aspects have been validated:

*   **Data Creation & Retrieval**:
    *   Anonymous users can successfully create and retrieve their session-specific data (cart items, policies, wallets, payment methods, conversations).
    *   Authenticated users can successfully create and retrieve their own user-specific data.
*   **RLS Data Isolation**:
    *   **Anonymous Sessions**: Confirmed that one anonymous session cannot access data belonging to a different anonymous session. The `test_anonymous_flow.sql` script's Test 7 (`RLS Policy Validation`) now correctly shows 0 records visible when querying for another session's data as the `anon` role.
    *   **Authenticated Users**: Confirmed that one authenticated user (simulated via JWT claims and `SET ROLE`) cannot access data belonging to another authenticated user. The `test_authenticated_flow.sql` script's Test 6 (`RLS Policy Validation - Data Isolation`) now correctly shows 0 records visible when User 2 attempts to query User 1's data.
*   **Policy Correctness**: The iterative refinement of RLS policies and test scripts has ensured that policies behave as intended under various conditions.
*   **Migration Readiness**: Tables involved in potential anonymous-to-authenticated data migration (`quote_cart_items`, `policy`, `user_wallets`, `user_payment_methods`, `conversations`) have the necessary `user_id` (nullable) and `anonymous_session_id` columns, confirmed by Test 8 in `test_anonymous_flow.sql`.

### 2.5. Better-Auth Integration (Phase E)

Phase E, focused on integrating Better-Auth middleware for robust authentication and session management, has been successfully completed.

**Key Achievements in Phase E:**

*   **Core Better-Auth Setup**:
    *   Configured Better-Auth with the Drizzle adapter for PostgreSQL.
    *   Initialized Better-Auth with Google OAuth as the primary social provider.
    *   Ensured environment variables for Google Client ID, Client Secret, and Better-Auth Secret are correctly loaded by the `apps/web` Next.js application (by placing a dedicated `.env` file in `apps/web/`).
*   **Server-Side Utilities (`packages/core/auth`)**:
    *   `auth.ts`: Centralized Better-Auth configuration. Resolved issues with dynamic imports and deprecated `generateId` configuration.
    *   `utils.ts`: Developed `getAuthContext`, `requireAuth`, `getAnonymousSessionId`, and `setRLSContext` to work with Next.js server components and Route Handlers patterns (e.g., `headers()`, `cookies()`).
*   **Client-Side Auth Management (`apps/web/src/lib/auth-client.tsx`)**:
    *   Implemented `AuthProvider` and `useAuth` hooks for React components.
    *   Integrated client-side anonymous session ID generation and management (`localStorage`).
    *   Ensured `AuthProvider` correctly wraps the React Router application within the hybrid navigation model (`shell/page.tsx` -> `ClientAppRoot.tsx` -> `frontend/app.tsx`).
    *   Developed `completeSignup` function to call the backend API for post-authentication user setup (e.g., wallet creation, data migration).
*   **API Routes & Middleware**:
    *   `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`: Standard Better-Auth catch-all route for handling OAuth flows.
    *   `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/user/auth/complete-signup/route.ts`: Backend endpoint for finalizing user signup after authentication.
    *   `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`: Next.js middleware updated for basic anonymous session cookie handling and header propagation.
*   **Troubleshooting & Refinements**:
    *   Addressed TypeScript errors across the auth implementation.
    *   Resolved issues related to environment variable loading in the `apps/web` Next.js context within a monorepo.
    *   Fixed layout and scrolling issues on test pages by correcting global CSS overrides (specifically `overflow-hidden` on `<body>` in `app/layout.tsx`) and ensuring proper `AuthProvider` placement within the hybrid navigation structure.
    *   Validated Google Sign-In flow, including callback handling via `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` and the `completeSignup` process.
*   **Test Page (`apps/web/src/app/test-auth/page.tsx`)**:
    *   Enhanced for testing anonymous sessions, Google Sign-In/Sign-Out, session refresh, and the `completeSignup` flow within the React Router context.

The authentication system is now functional, supporting both anonymous user sessions and authenticated user flows via Google OAuth.

## 3. Current Project Status

With the completion of Phase E (Better-Auth Integration), the project now has a functional authentication layer on top of the robust database schema and RLS policies established earlier. Key aspects include:

*   **Foundation (Database & RLS):** Remains solid and validated.
*   **Authentication (Better-Auth):** Successfully integrated, supporting Google OAuth and anonymous sessions. User sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session management are operational. The `complete-signup` flow for new users, including custodial wallet placeholder creation and anonymous data migration, is also functional.
*   **Environment & Build:** Issues related to environment variable loading in the `apps/web` Next.js application have been resolved. TypeScript errors pertaining to the auth system have been fixed.
*   **Hybrid Navigation Compatibility:** The authentication client (`AuthProvider`, `useAuth`) has been integrated to work correctly within the project's hybrid Next.js + React Router navigation model.

The project is **now ready to proceed to Phase F: Anonymous Session Handling (Client-side implementation)**. The backend and authentication systems are well-prepared to support deeper integration of anonymous user data with client-side interactions and eventual migration upon authentication.

## 4. Next Steps

With Phase E completed, the immediate focus shifts to enhancing the client-side experience for anonymous users.

*   **Phase E: Better-Auth Middleware Setup ✅ (Completed)**
*   **Phase F: Anonymous Session Handling (Client-side implementation) 🎯 (Current Priority)**
    *   Develop robust client-side logic for managing anonymous user data (e.g., quote cart items, chat history) using the established anonymous session ID.
    *   Integrate these client-side anonymous data operations with API endpoints, ensuring the `x-anonymous-session-id` header is correctly sent.
    *   Ensure seamless user experience when transitioning from an anonymous to an authenticated state (data migration is handled by `complete-signup`, but client UI should reflect this).
*   **Phase G: Documentation Updates**
    *   Update Core PRDs (Database Schema, API Specs, etc.) to reflect the Better-Auth implementation and any changes to anonymous session handling logic.
    *   Document the authentication flow and setup, including environment variable requirements for `apps/web`.
*   **Phase H: Final Validation & End-to-End Foundation Testing**
    *   Conduct thorough testing of all user flows: anonymous interactions, authentication, authenticated interactions, data migration, and RLS policy enforcement across all states.
    *   Include API and UI interaction testing.

This continued progress builds upon the secure and scalable platform established for the triggerr MVP.
