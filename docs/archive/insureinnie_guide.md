## Escrow Mechanics

### Who Funds What?
- **Customer**: Pays only the premium (e.g., $30, $89.99)
- **Provider**: Funds the escrow with coverage amount (e.g., $500, $3,000)
- **Platform**: Collects fees from transactions

### Escrow Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Provider locks coverage amount in smart contract
2. **Monitoring**: System tracks flight status automatically
3. **Fulfillment Options**:
   - **Customer fulfills**: If delay conditions met, customer gets coverage
   - **Provider fulfills**: If no delay/expiration, provider reclaims funds

### Coverage Amounts
- **Economy travelers**: $500-$1,000
- **Business travelers**: $3,000-$5,000
- **Premium/First class**: $7,500-$8,500
- **Corporate clients**: Up to $7,500+

### Realistic Premium Rates
- **Typical range**: 3-10% of ticket price
- **Economy example**: $350 ticket → $10-25 premium → $500-1,000 coverage
- **Business example**: $1,100 ticket → $90 premium → $3,000 coverage
