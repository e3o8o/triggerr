## 4. Technical Architecture & Implementation Strategy

### API-First Development Approach

**Public APIs** (No Authentication Required):
```
GET  /api/public/flights/search          # Search flights for insurance
POST /api/public/insurance/quote         # Generate anonymous quotes
GET  /api/public/insurance/products      # List available insurance products
POST /api/public/chat/message            # Conversational AI interface
```

**Authenticated APIs** (User Session Required):
```
POST /api/auth/register                  # User registration
POST /api/auth/login                     # User authentication
GET  /api/user/conversations             # User's chat history
POST /api/user/conversations             # Create new conversation
GET  /api/user/policies                  # User's active policies
POST /api/user/policies/purchase         # Purchase insurance policy
```

**Internal APIs** (System Use):
```
POST /api/internal/monitoring/check      # Flight status monitoring
POST /api/internal/payouts/process       # Automatic payout processing
GET  /api/internal/analytics/metrics     # Platform analytics
```

### Technology Stack & Project Structure

└── internal/                 # System endpoints
```

### Data Flow Architecture

**Conversational Insurance Flow**:
1. User enters query in chat interface
2. Frontend sends query to `/api/public/chat/message`
3. Backend processes query with LLM for intent recognition
4. System queries flight data APIs for risk assessment
5. Insurance engine calculates quotes from multiple providers
6. Results returned as structured card data
7. Frontend renders interactive insurance cards
8. User can continue conversation or purchase directly

**Anonymous-to-Authenticated Conversion**:
1. Anonymous user interacts with chat interface
2. Conversation history stored in browser localStorage
3. User decides to purchase or save quotes
4. Authentication modal appears with Google OAuth
5. Post-authentication, browser data syncs to user account
6. Persistent conversation history maintained server-side

### Security Model (RLS + Better-Auth)

**Row Level Security Implementation**:
```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY user_own_data ON conversations
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.user_id());

-- Anonymous users can access public insurance data
CREATE POLICY public_insurance_read ON insurance_products
  FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);

-- Providers can only access their own policies
CREATE POLICY provider_own_policies ON policies
  FOR ALL USING (provider_id = auth.provider_id());
```

**Authentication Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Google OAuth via Better-Auth
- **Anonymous Sessions**: Temporary JWT tokens for conversation tracking
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request validation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

---

## 5. Database Architecture & Data Foundation

### Comprehensive Reference Data

**Insurance Products** (Seeded Data):
```sql
INSERT INTO insurance_products (id, name, description, base_premium, coverage_amount, provider_id) VALUES
('flight-delay-basic', 'Flight Delay Basic', 'Coverage for delays over 2 hours', 19.99, 300.00, 'triggerr-direct'),
('flight-delay-premium', 'Flight Delay Premium', 'Enhanced coverage with 1 hour trigger', 34.99, 500.00, 'triggerr-direct'),
('baggage-delay', 'Baggage Delay Protection', 'Coverage for delayed baggage', 12.99, 200.00, 'triggerr-direct');
```

**Airport & Airline Reference Data**:
```sql
-- Comprehensive airport database with delay statistics
CREATE TABLE airports (
  id VARCHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL,
  timezone TEXT NOT NULL,
  delay_statistics JSONB, -- Historical delay data
  weather_risk_score INTEGER
);

-- Airline reliability data
CREATE TABLE airlines (
  iata_code VARCHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  reliability_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  delay_statistics JSONB
);
```

### Enhanced Schema Evolution

**Conversation Management**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  anonymous_session_id TEXT, -- For anonymous users
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  metadata JSONB -- Store search context, preferences
);

CREATE TABLE conversation_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant', 'system')),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB, -- Store card data, search results
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Insurance Navigator** (Shopping Cart Equivalent):
```sql
CREATE TABLE insurance_selections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
  insurance_product_id TEXT REFERENCES insurance_products(id),
  flight_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- Flight details for this selection
  quoted_premium DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  coverage_details JSONB NOT NULL,
  selected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'saved' CHECK (status IN ('saved', 'purchased', 'expired'))
);
```

## 6. API Architecture & Endpoints

### Public APIs (Anonymous Access)

**Chat Interface APIs**:

  };
}

interface ChatMessageResponse {
  response: string;
  conversationId: string;
  insuranceCards?: InsuranceCard[];
  flightData?: FlightInformation;
  suggestedQuestions?: string[];
}
```

**Insurance Quoting APIs**:
```typescript

interface QuoteRequest {
  flightNumber: string;
  departureDate: string;
  passengers: number;
  coveragePreferences?: {
    maxPremium?: number;
    minCoverage?: number;
    triggerTime?: number; // Hours of delay
  };
}

interface QuoteResponse {
  quotes: InsuranceQuote[];
  flightRisk: RiskAssessment;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### Authenticated APIs (User Management)

**Conversation Management**:
```typescript
// GET /api/user/conversations
interface ConversationListResponse {
  conversations: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    lastMessage: string;
    lastUpdated: string;
    messageCount: number;
  }[];
  pagination: PaginationInfo;
}

// POST /api/user/conversations/{id}/sync
interface ConversationSyncRequest {
  anonymousMessages: ChatMessage[];
  anonymousSelections: InsuranceSelection[];
}
```

**Policy Management**:
```typescript
// GET /api/user/policies
interface PolicyListResponse {
  activePolicies: Policy[];
  pastPolicies: Policy[];
  upcomingFlights: FlightMonitoring[];
  totalCoverage: number;
  totalPremiumsPaid: number;
}
```

By drawing inspiration from successful chat applications like Chat0 while maintaining focus on insurance expertise, triggerr will create a new category of insurance technology that educates, engages, and empowers users through conversation.

The phased implementation approach ensures rapid time-to-market while building a foundation for long-term growth and expansion into adjacent markets. The API-first architecture provides flexibility for future integrations and B2B opportunities, while the chat-first interface creates a distinctive competitive advantage in the parametric insurance market.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this comprehensive vision
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation with core APIs
3. Establish design system based on Chat0 inspiration
4. Start building the foundational chat interface
5. Prepare for rapid iteration and user feedback cycles
