# Unified Project Roadmap: MVP Completion & Enhancements

**Overall Goal**: To deliver a feature-complete MVP including the full quote-to-payout lifecycle, and to enhance the developer tooling for future growth. This document supersedes the original `paygo_integration_tracker.md` and the `PLANNER MODE` task list by combining all remaining work into a single source of truth.

---

## ✅ I. Completed Work Summary

The foundational work for the project is complete. This includes the entire **PayGo Adapter & Client Service**, the core functionalities of the **Wallet Service**, the **System Health Endpoints**, and a **fully functional Transaction History API**. The PayGo decimal system has been corrected to a base-100 model, and all 147 tests pass, confirming a stable base for the remaining tasks.

The focus now shifts to implementing the core business logic and enhancing our developer tools.

## 📋 II. Remaining Tasks & Implementation Plan

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY: Core MVP Functionality

#### **Task 1: Implement Quote Engine**
*   **Objective**: Create a foundational service to generate insurance quotes, which is a prerequisite for purchasing a policy.
*   **Files**: `packages/services/quote-engine/`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1/quote/`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Create the `quote-engine` package structure and a `QuoteService` class.
    *   [ ] Implement a basic `generateQuote` method (can return a mock/static quote for MVP).
    *   [ ] Define a `quote` table in the database schema (`packages/core/src/database/schema.ts`) to store generated quote details.
    *   [ ] Create a `POST /api/v1/quote/generate` endpoint to expose the service.
    *   [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and request validation.

#### **Task 2: Implement Policy Purchase Endpoint**
*   **Objective**: Complete the core business functionality by allowing users to purchase policies based on a generated quote.
*   **Corresponds to Tracker**: Sub-Phase 3.1
*   **Files**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/policy/purchase.ts`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Implement request body parsing to accept a `quoteId`.
    *   [ ] Look up the quote details from the database using the `quoteId` to ensure price integrity.
    *   [ ] Integrate with the `EscrowManager` to create a `POLICY`-type escrow for the verified premium amount.
    *   [ ] Create a `policy` record in the database, linking it to the user, the quote, and the on-chain escrow.
    *   [ ] Return a proper response containing the `policyId` and `transactionHash`.

#### **Task 3: Implement Payout Engine**
*   **Objective**: Automate payouts for policies upon claim validation.
*   **Corresponds to Tracker**: Sub-Phase 4.1
*   **Files**: `packages/services/payout-engine/`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1/internal/payouts/process-triggered/index.ts`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Implement the `processTriggeredPayouts(policyIds: string[])` method in `payout-engine.ts`.
    *   [ ] This method should fetch policies and user wallets from the database.
    *   [ ] Determine if claim conditions are met (MVP logic can be simplified, e.g., triggered by API call).
    *   [ ] Call `EscrowManager.releaseEscrow()` for the correct policy escrow ID.
    *   [ ] Update the policy status in the database (e.g., to `CLAIMED`).
    *   [ ] Record the payout transaction in the `payout` table.
    *   [ ] Update the API endpoint to use the new service logic.

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Dev-Dashboard & API Enhancements

#### **Task 4: Create Advanced Transaction Parser**
*   **Objective**: Decode all advanced transaction types discovered in the PayGo test files to provide richer data in the UI.
*   **Files**: `packages/blockchain/paygo-adapter/src/transaction-parser.ts`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Implement parsing logic for `UpsertDelegation` transactions.
    *   [ ] Implement parsing logic for `DelegateTransfer` transactions.
    *   [ ] Ensure the parser gracefully handles any other unknown transaction types.

#### **Task 5: Implement Delegation API Endpoints**
*   **Objective**: Expose the full delegation capabilities of the PayGo client via the API.
*   **Files**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/user/wallet/delegations/`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Create a `POST /delegations/create` endpoint.
    *   [ ] Create a `POST /delegations/send` endpoint for delegated transfers.
    *   [ ] Create a `GET /delegations` endpoint (will require DB persistence, see Task 7).

#### **Task 6: Enhance Dev-Dashboard UI**
*   **Objective**: Display the rich transaction and delegation data now available.
*   **Files**: `apps/web/src/app/dev-dashboard/components/`
*   **Sub-tasks**:
    *   [ ] Enhance the `WalletTab` to correctly display all parsed transaction types (e.g., show "Delegate To" for delegation transactions).
    *   [ ] Add a new "Delegations" tab to the UI.
    *   [ ] Implement UI forms for creating new delegations and executing delegated transfers.

### 🔵 LOW PRIORITY / BLOCKED / POST-MVP

*   **`getEscrowStatus` Implementation (Blocked)**: This feature, which would query the status of an on-chain escrow, remains blocked pending the availability of the required API from the PayGo network.
*   **Database Persistence for Advanced Features (Future)**: To fully support `GET /delegations`, a `delegations` table should be added to the database schema to persistently store created delegations.
*   **Secure Key Management (Post-MVP)**: A full integration with a KMS for secure private key retrieval and use in user-initiated transactions is a critical post-MVP security enhancement.

---

## III. Testing & Verification (Remaining)

*   [ ] **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the `payout-engine` and `quote-engine` once they are implemented.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests**:
    *   [ ] Write a comprehensive integration test for the `policy/purchase` endpoint.
    *   [ ] Implement end-to-end PayGo testnet tests for the full lifecycle, leveraging patterns from `working_tests/test-paygo-full.js`.
*   [ ] **E2E Tests**: (Future) Create new E2E tests for the full user flow (quote -> purchase -> claim -> payout).
*   [ ] **Manual PayGo Testnet Verification**: Manually verify all key transactions on a testnet explorer.

---

## IV. Documentation Updates (Remaining)

*   [ ] **API Reference**: Update `triggerr/docs/03_development/api_reference/README.md` with the final status and details of all endpoints.
*   [ ] **API Placeholders**: Delete the relevant `.md` files from `docs/03_development/api_reference/placeholders/` once the `quote/generate` and `policy/purchase` APIs are fully implemented.


## **Comprehensive Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan (Updated)**

### **I. Executive Summary**

Based on my thorough analysis of the current project state, I can provide a detailed status report. The project is in an **excellent position**, with the vast majority of the foundational work now complete.

### **III. Detailed Gap Analysis (Updated)**

#### **A. CRITICAL GAPS**

*   <span style="color:green;">**[CLOSED]**</span> **Gap 2: System Health Endpoints**
    *   **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
    *   **Resolution**: A full suite of health check endpoints has been implemented under `apps/api/src/routes/v1/health/` and successfully integrated into the `dev-dashboard`.

*   <span style="color:green;">**[CLOSED]**</span> **Gap 7: Test-Auth Page Health Status**
    *   **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
    *   **Resolution**: The `test-auth` page was superseded by the `dev-dashboard`, which uses live API calls to display system health.

*   **Gap 1: Policy Purchase Endpoint**
    *   **Status**: 🔴 **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Current State**: The file `triggerr/apps/api/src/routes/v1/policy/purchase.ts` still returns a `501 Not Implemented` error.
    *   **Impact**: **CRITICAL**. This is the final blocker to completing the core MVP user flow.

*   **Gap 4 & 5: Business Logic Services & Chat Integration**
    *   **Status**: 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Current State**: The service directories (`quote-engine`, `policy-engine`, `chat-service`) have been created, but they contain placeholder logic. The corresponding API endpoints (`/quote/generate`, `/chat/message`) are still using mock implementations.
    *   **Impact**: **CRITICAL**. The core business logic of the application is not yet implemented.

#### **B. OTHER GAPS**

*   **Gap 3: Payout Engine Integration**
    *   **Status**: 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Current State**: The `payout-engine` service exists, but the core `processTriggeredPayouts` logic is not implemented.
    *   **Impact**: **MEDIUM**. This is required for the automated payout part of the MVP.

*   **Gap 6: Anonymous Session Management**
    *   **Status**: 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Current State**: Basic hooks for anonymous sessions are in place, but the full-featured `AnonymousSessionManager` for handling quote carts and conversations is not yet built.
    *   **Impact**: **MEDIUM**. Needed for a seamless anonymous user experience.

### **IV. Systematic Implementation Plan (Updated)**

The path forward is now clearer than ever. We will proceed with the unified plan we created.

#### **Phase 1: Implement Core Business Logic (Quote & Policy)**
*   **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Implement the foundational `Quote Engine`.
    2.  Implement the `policy/purchase` endpoint, consuming the quotes.
    3.  Thoroughly test the end-to-end flow.

#### **Phase 2: Complete the MVP Lifecycle (Payouts)**
*   **Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH**
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Implement the `Payout Engine` service logic.
    2.  Add unit and integration tests for payouts.

#### **Phase 3: Enhance Features (Delegation & UI)**
*   **Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Complete the advanced `transaction-parser`.
    2.  Build the delegation API endpoints.
    3.  Enhance the `dev-dashboard` with delegation UI.

### **V. Conclusion & Recommendation**

The project is stable, and the foundational layers are complete and robust. The `dev-dashboard` is now a reliable tool with live data. The remaining work is entirely focused on implementing the application's core business logic.

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Proceed with Phase 1** of the updated implementation plan immediately: **build the `Quote Engine`**.

## **Consolidated Gap Analysis & Remaining Work**

This document provides a definitive, code-verified list of all remaining tasks and identified gaps required to complete Phase F.

#### **Gap 1: Foundational Business Logic Services are Incomplete**
This is the most critical gap, blocking most other progress.

*   **1.1: Aggregators are Not Implemented**
    *   **Location**: `packages/aggregators/`
    *   **Status**: ❌ **MISSING**. The directory is empty.
    *   **Description**: The plan requires a `flight-aggregator`, `weather-aggregator`, and `data-router`. These are critical dependencies for the `QuoteEngine` and advanced escrow logic. They must be built.

*   **1.2: Business Logic Services are Placeholders**
    *   **Location**: `packages/services/`
    *   **Status**: 🚧 **INCOMPLETE**.
    *   **Description**: The `quote-engine`, `policy-engine`, and `payout-engine` packages contain no functional logic. They are empty shells and cannot be integrated into the API layer yet.

*   **1.3: Service Dependencies are Not Injected**
    *   **Location**: `packages/services/escrow-engine/src/escrow-engine.ts`
    *   **Status**: 🚧 **INCOMPLETE**.
    *   **Description**: The `SingleSidedEscrowEngine` constructor is missing its planned dependencies (`flightAggregator`, `logger`, `escrowIdGenerator`). This prevents it from performing its full, intended role. To fix this, the `EscrowEngineFactory` must be refactored to support dependency injection.

#### **Gap 2: Core MVP API Endpoints are Not Implemented**
The API route structure exists, but the business logic behind the key routes is missing.

*   **2.1: Policy Purchase Endpoint is a Mock**
    *   **Location**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/policy/purchase.ts`
    *   **Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**.
    *   **Description**: This endpoint currently returns a `501 Not Implemented` error. It needs to be implemented to use the (currently non-existent) `QuoteEngine` and `EscrowManager`.

*   **2.2: Payout Processing Endpoint is a Mock**
    *   **Location**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/internal/payouts/process-triggered/index.ts`
    *   **Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**.
    *   **Description**: This endpoint does not have the `PayoutEngine` logic to connect to.

*   **2.3: Chat Service Endpoints are Mocks**
    *   **Location**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/chat/`
    *   **Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**.
    *   **Description**: The chat-related API routes are placeholders and are not connected to a functional `ChatService`.

#### **Gap 3: Advanced Infrastructure and Middleware is Missing**
The API server is functional but lacks production-grade supporting features.

*   **3.1: Centralized Logging is Not Integrated**
    *   **Status**: 🚧 **INCOMPLETE**.
    *   **Description**: While `packages/infrastructure/logging` exists, the services (like `EscrowEngine`) are not actually using it. Error handling is basic and inconsistent.

*   **3.2: Advanced Middleware is Not Implemented**
    *   **Status**: ❌ **MISSING**.
    *   **Description**: The API lacks crucial middleware for rate limiting, advanced CORS handling, and structured request logging.

*   **3.3: Advanced Architectural Patterns are Not Implemented**
    *   **Status**: ❌ **MISSING**.
    *   **Description**: Patterns mentioned in the plan like Service Discovery, Circuit Breakers, and Event Sourcing have not been implemented.

#### **Gap 4: Client-Side Anonymous Session Management is Incomplete**
*   **Location**: `apps/web/src/lib/`
*   **Status**: ❌ **MISSING**.
*   **Description**: The `AnonymousSessionManager.ts` file and class do not exist. While the API can handle anonymous headers, the client-side logic for managing quote carts and conversation history for anonymous users is not built.

#### **Gap 5: Testing Coverage is Incomplete**
*   **Status**: 🚧 **INCOMPLETE**.
*   **Description**: While the foundational services have excellent unit test coverage (147 tests), there is no test coverage for the missing business logic services (`QuoteEngine`, `PolicyEngine`, `PayoutEngine`). Integration and End-to-End tests for the full user journey are also pending.

---

This consolidated list represents the full scope of remaining work. Our immediate priority must be **Gap 1: Foundational Business Logic Services**, as it is the primary blocker for everything else.

Unified Refactoring Plan**

Our objective is to align the `escrow-engine` with the architectural plan, making it both maintainable and future-proof.

**1. Breaking the File (Code Organization)**
*   **Action**: Move the `SingleSidedEscrowEngine` and `UserInitiatedEscrowEngine` classes out of the monolithic `escrow-engine.ts` file and into their own dedicated files:
    *   `packages/services/escrow-engine/src/single-sided.engine.ts`
    *   `packages/services/escrow-engine/src/user-initiated.engine.ts`
*   **Goal**: Improve readability and create a clean pattern for adding new engine models in the future.

**2. Updating the Constructor (Meeting the Plan's Requirements)**
*   **Action**: Modify the constructor of the `SingleSidedEscrowEngine` to accept the full set of dependencies required by the architectural plan.
    *   **From**: `constructor(paygoClient)`
    *   **To**: `constructor(paygoAdapter, flightAggregator, logger, escrowIdGenerator)`
*   **Goal**: Ensure the engine has access to all the tools it needs for its full range of responsibilities.

**3. Implementing Dependency Injection (The "How-To" for the Constructor)**
*   **Action**: This is the key change that enables the new constructor. We will refactor the `EscrowEngineFactory`:
    *   Convert it from a `static` class to a regular (non-static) class.
    *   Inject all potential dependencies (`PayGoClientService`, `FlightAggregator`, `Logger`, etc.) into the factory's *own* constructor.
    *   Update the factory's `createEngine` method to pass the correct dependencies to the specific engine it is creating.
*   **Goal**: Make the system flexible enough to handle engines with different dependency needs, thus making it "future-proof" as a an architectural note.

---

You are exactly right—these three items are interconnected and represent the complete refactoring task ahead of us. We will perform them in this logical order.

I am ready to start with **Step 1: Breaking the File**. Shall I proceed?


## Report Mode**: `report detailed`
**Report Date**: June 24, 2025
**Objective**: To provide a complete historical context of our architectural analysis and to present a hyperdetailed, unified implementation plan for completing Phase F and the core MVP.

---

### **I. Executive Summary**

This report encapsulates a session of intense architectural review and strategic planning. We began with a high-level plan and, through a meticulous, step-by-step verification process, have uncovered critical gaps between the plan and the reality of the codebase.

The most significant discovery is that foundational components, such as the `packages/aggregators/`, were not yet implemented, and core services like the `EscrowEngine` were not being created with their full, planned set of dependencies. This has blocked the implementation of all subsequent business logic.

As a result of this analysis, we have made a key architectural decision: **we will refactor the `EscrowEngineFactory` and its related services *before* implementing the final business logic.** This involves two parallel streams of work: organizing the file structure for maintainability and refactoring the dependency injection pattern to make the system truly future-proof.

This updated, unified plan is now the definitive roadmap. It prioritizes closing these foundational gaps first, ensuring that when we build the `Quote Engine` and `Policy Engine`, we are building on solid, architecturally-sound ground.

---

### **II. Summary of Analysis & Discoveries (Historical Narrative)**

1.  **Initial Plan Review**: We started with the `phase_f_completion_plan.md`, which outlined a clear path forward.
2.  **Gap Identification (F.3)**: Our initial review of Section F.3 revealed a major discrepancy. The plan called for the integration of `packages/aggregators/`, but a codebase check confirmed this directory was empty. This single finding invalidated the original assumption that all foundational pieces were in place.
3.  **Deeper Dive (F.4)**: Prompted by this, we investigated the `EscrowEngine` implementation. We discovered that its constructor was much simpler than planned, lacking critical dependencies like the `flightAggregator` and `logger`.
4.  **Architectural Crossroads**: This led to a crucial discussion. We confirmed that to support the vision in `01_VISION_MASTER.md` (e.g., weather-based products), the `EscrowEngine` would need a flexible way to handle various data sources and services.
5.  **The "Future-Proofing" Decision**: We collectively decided against a temporary patch. Instead, we have committed to a proactive refactoring of the `EscrowEngineFactory` to use a non-static, dependency-injected pattern. This decision, while adding a small amount of upfront work, makes the architecture robust, scalable, and ready for all 14 planned escrow models.
6.  **Unifying the Plan**: Finally, we consolidated all remaining tasks from the `paygo_integration_tracker.md` and our new findings into a single, actionable plan, which is detailed below.

---

### **III. Analysis of Core Issues & The Path Forward**

The core issue was a deviation between the architectural plan and the implementation. The plan assumed a level of completeness in the foundational services that did not exist.

Our path forward is now to **remediate this architectural debt first**. We will pause the direct implementation of new features (like the `Quote Engine`) and first execute a targeted refactoring of the `escrow-engine` to make it fully compliant with the architectural vision.

---

### **IV. The Unified Implementation Plan: Remaining Tasks**

This is the single source of truth for all work required to complete the MVP.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring (Immediate Priority)**
**Objective**: To align the `escrow-engine` with the architectural plan, making it maintainable and future-proof.

*   **Task 1.1: File Structure Refactor (Code Organization)**
    *   **Action**: Move the `SingleSidedEscrowEngine` and `UserInitiatedEscrowEngine` classes from `escrow-engine.ts` into their own dedicated files (`single-sided.engine.ts`, `user-initiated.engine.ts`).
    *   **Goal**: Improve readability and establish a clean pattern for adding new engine models.

*   **Task 1.2: Implement Placeholder Dependencies**
    *   **Action**: Create the placeholder `flight-aggregator/src/index.ts` and `infrastructure/logging/src/index.ts` files and export placeholder `FlightAggregator` and `Logger` classes.
    *   **Goal**: Provide the necessary objects and types to be used in the dependency injection refactor.

*   **Task 1.3: Dependency Injection & Constructor Refactor**
    *   **Action**:
        1.  Refactor the `EscrowEngineFactory` from a `static` class to a regular (non-static) class.
        2.  Inject all potential dependencies (`PayGoClientService`, `FlightAggregator`, `Logger`, etc.) into the new factory's constructor.
        3.  Update the `SingleSidedEscrowEngine` constructor to accept its full, planned set of dependencies.
        4.  Update the `EscrowManager` to correctly instantiate and use the new non-static factory.
    *   **Goal**: Fulfill the "Future-Proofing" requirement and make the engine capable of handling advanced logic.

---
#### **Phase 2: Core Business Logic Implementation (High Priority)**
**Objective**: To build the services required for the core MVP user flow.

*   **Task 2.1: Implement Foundational Aggregators**
    *   **Location**: `packages/aggregators/`
    *   **Action**: Flesh out the placeholder `FlightAggregator` with basic logic to fetch data from the `packages/integrations/`.

*   **Task 2.2: Implement Quote Engine**
    *   **Location**: `packages/services/quote-engine/`
    *   **Action**: Implement the `QuoteService` class and its `generateQuote` method, using the `FlightAggregator`. Define the `quote` table in the database schema and create the `POST /api/v1/quote/generate` endpoint.

*   **Task 2.3: Implement Policy Purchase Endpoint**
    *   **Location**: `apps/api/src/routes/v1/policy/purchase.ts`
    *   **Action**: Implement the logic to look up a quote, create a policy record in the database, and call the `EscrowManager` to create the on-chain `POLICY`-type escrow.

*   **Task 2.4: Implement Payout Engine**
    *   **Location**: `packages/services/payout-engine/`
    *   **Action**: Implement the `processTriggeredPayouts` method, which will use the aggregators to check conditions and the `EscrowManager` to release funds.

---
#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI (Medium Priority)**
**Objective**: To expose all of PayGo's advanced capabilities and build the UI to match.

*   **Task 3.1: Enhance Transaction Parser**: Update the parser in `paygo-adapter` to decode `UpsertDelegation` and `DelegateTransfer` transactions.
*   **Task 3.2: Implement Delegation API Endpoints**: Create the `create`, `send`, and `get` endpoints for delegations under `/api/v1/user/wallet/delegations/`.
*   **Task 3.3: Enhance Dev-Dashboard UI**: Add a "Delegations" tab and related forms to the UI.

---
#### **Phase 4: Finalization (Low Priority / Post-MVP)**
*   **Task 4.1: Complete Testing**: Write missing unit tests for new services and add integration/E2E tests for the full user flow.
*   **Task 4.2: Finalize Documentation**: Update all API reference documents and create guides for the new features.
*   **Task 4.3: Implement Full Anonymous Session Manager**: Build the `AnonymousSessionManager` class to handle quote carts and conversation history for anonymous users.
*   **Task 4.4: Address Blocked/Future Items**: Re-evaluate the `getEscrowStatus` implementation and implement database persistence for delegations.

---

### **V. Curated List of Essential Files for Next Session**

*   **The Engine Core**: `triggerr/packages/services/escrow-engine/src/escrow-engine.ts` (This is where the main refactoring will happen).
*   **Aggregator Placeholder**: `triggerr/packages/aggregators/flight-aggregator/src/index.ts` (To be created).
*   **Logger Placeholder**: `triggerr/packages/infrastructure/logging/src/index.ts` (To be created or verified).
*   **The Generator**: `triggerr/packages/core/utils/escrow-id-generator.ts` (Will be injected).
*   **The Guide**: `triggerr/docs/03_development/phase_f_completion_plan.md` (To keep us aligned with the architectural vision).

This detailed plan provides a clear, logical, and risk-mitigated path to completing the project. I am ready to begin with **Phase 1, Task 1.1**: Breaking the `escrow-engine.ts` file apart.
