# PayGo Integration Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
The PayGo integration that was previously working is now failing with a deserialization error when trying to get account information. The error occurs specifically when calling the `getAccountInfo` method on the PayGo client.

## Error Details
```
error: error deserializing server function results: missing field `nonce` at line 1 column 89
```

**Location**: `@witnessco/paygo-ts-client/dist/index.js:2833:17`

**Stack Trace**:
```

```

## Technical Context

### Environment Setup
- **Project**: Triggerr blockchain integration
- **Package**: `@witnessco/paygo-ts-client` (WASM-based client)
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Network**: PayGo testnet (configured via `PAYGO_NETWORK_URL`)

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
PAYGO_ADMIN_PK=<private_key>
PAYGO_NETWORK_URL=<paygo_network_endpoint>
```

### Code Flow
1. Client initialization succeeds
2. Private key setting succeeds
3. Account address generation succeeds
4. **FAILURE**: `getAccountInfo()` call fails during server response deserialization

## Root Cause Analysis

### Known Issue from Previous Learnings
This is **NOT a new issue** - it's a documented problem from our previous PayGo integration work. According to the learnings document, this exact error pattern was encountered and resolved before.

### Likely Causes
1. **PayGo Network Service Issue**: The PayGo network service might be:
   - Down or unreachable
   - Returning malformed responses
   - Experiencing version incompatibility

2. **Response Format Change**: The server response format may have changed, causing the WASM client to fail parsing the `nonce` field.

3. **Network Configuration**: The `PAYGO_NETWORK_URL` might be pointing to:
   - An incorrect endpoint
   - A service that's no longer available
   - A different version of the PayGo service

4. **Client-Server Version Mismatch**: The `@witnessco/paygo-ts-client` version might be incompatible with the current PayGo network version.

5. **WASM Runtime Environment Issue**: The learnings document shows this is a known WebAssembly binding issue that can occur in certain runtime environments.

## Investigation Steps Needed

### 1. Network Connectivity
- Verify `PAYGO_NETWORK_URL` is correct and accessible
- Test direct HTTP requests to the PayGo network endpoint
- Check if the service is responding with proper JSON

### 2. Response Analysis
- Capture the raw server response before WASM deserialization
- Compare response format with expected schema
- Check if the `nonce` field is present in the response

### 3. Version Compatibility
- Check PayGo network version vs client version compatibility
- Verify if there have been recent updates to either component

### 4. Alternative Endpoints
- Test with different PayGo network URLs
- Try connecting to a different PayGo network instance

## Debugging Approach

### Immediate Actions
1. **Network Test**: Make a direct HTTP request to `PAYGO_NETWORK_URL` to verify connectivity
2. **Response Logging**: Add logging to capture raw server responses before WASM processing
3. **Version Check**: Verify PayGo network and client versions are compatible

### Code Modifications Needed
```typescript
// Add response logging before WASM deserialization
console.log('Raw server response:', rawResponse);
console.log('Expected nonce field location:', responseStructure);
```

## Previous Working State
- The integration was working before this issue
- No code changes were made to the PayGo adapter
- The issue appears to be external (network/service related)

## Next Steps
1. Verify PayGo network service status
2. Check for any recent PayGo network updates
3. Test with alternative PayGo endpoints
4. Consider downgrading/upgrading the `@witnessco/paygo-ts-client` version
5. Implement response logging to capture the actual server response format
