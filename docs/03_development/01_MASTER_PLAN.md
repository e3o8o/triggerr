# 01_MASTER_PLAN: triggerr Project Development Roadmap & Status

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for the triggerr project's development roadmap, current status, and key tasks. It consolidates information from various planning documents to provide a clear, actionable overview.

## I. Executive Summary & Current Status

**Primary Objective**: Implement the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of the triggerr platform, focusing on Flight Delay Insurance with Automatic Payouts, built on a robust data foundation and secure authentication.

**Current Status**: **PHASE 6 (API Layer Completion) üéØ FINALIZING.**
The core backend services and APIs are complete and tested. The project is now focused on implementing the final policy purchase endpoint and connecting the production UI.

**Key Achievements (Recap of Recent Progress):**
*   **Stable Monorepo Configuration**: Architecturally refactored the TypeScript configuration, resulting in a stable, consistent, and maintainable build system.
*   **`dev-dashboard` Complete**: Built a comprehensive, high-fidelity `dev-dashboard` for internal testing, replacing the legacy `test-auth` page.
*   **Full System Health Monitoring**: Implemented and integrated a full suite of system health check endpoints, providing real-time visibility into the status of all core services.
*   **100% Test Suite Stability**: The entire monorepo test suite (147 tests) continues to pass, ensuring a stable foundation for CI/CD.

## II. MVP Scope Definition

**What's IN the MVP (from `triggerr_vision.md`):**
*   **Core User Flow**: Quote ‚Üí Policy ‚Üí Automatic Payout (for InsureCo's initial product).
*   **Marketplace Foundation**: triggerr (platform) + InsureCo (first provider, single-sided escrow model).
*   **Multi-Source Flight Data**: Aggregation from AviationStack, FlightAware, OpenSky, Weather APIs.
*   **Authentication**: Better-auth with Google OAuth.
*   **Multi-Escrow Architecture (Schema & Core Logic)**: All 14 escrow models supported in DB schema; MVP policy engine uses InsureCo's chosen model.
*   **Comprehensive Reference Data**: Database seeded with countries, regions, airlines, airports (with timezones), runways, aircraft types, and routes.
*   **Historical Data Persistence (Schema & Basic Ingestion)**: Tables for `historical_flight_segments` and `historical_weather_observations` defined; initial data ingestion from aggregator.
*   **Payment**: PayGo escrow with automatic release (utilizing robust Escrow ID system).
*   **Frontend**: Web application for MVP user flows.
*   **Monitoring**: Automated flight status checking for active policies.

**What's OUT of MVP (from `triggerr_vision.md`):**
*   Advanced multi-provider onboarding UI.
*   Full UI/logic for all 14 escrow models by providers.
*   Advanced admin dashboard.
*   Provider revenue sharing automation.
*   Complex historical data analysis features or ML model training.
*   Full utilization of all seeded reference data by MVP features.

## III. Implementation Roadmap (Phased Approach)

This roadmap outlines the critical phases to achieve the MVP. Progress is tracked incrementally.

### PHASE 1: Robust Foundation & Data Integration (Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Establish a comprehensive and durable data layer, and initial authentication setup.

*   **1.1 Data Persistence & Reference Schema Definition**:
    *   Defined ALL Reference Table Schemas (`countries`, `regions`, `airlines`, `airports`, `runways`, `aircraft_types`, `routes`).
    *   Defined Historical Data Persistence Schemas (`historical_flight_segments`, `historical_weather_observations`, `raw_api_call_logs`).
    *   Defined Drizzle Relations for all new/enhanced tables.
    *   Generated and ran `db:generate` migrations.
*   **1.2 Comprehensive Data Seeding**:
    *   Implemented seeding logic for ALL reference tables using provided seed files.
    *   Ran `db:migrate` and `db:seed`, thoroughly verifying all seeded data.
*   **1.3 Core Authentication Setup**:
    *   Better-Auth server configured with Google OAuth + Drizzle adapter.
    *   Escrow ID Generator implemented and documented.

### PHASE 2: Better-Auth Integration (Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Fully integrate Better-auth into the application, securing all routes and enabling user sessions.

*   **2.1 Next.js Middleware**: Implemented for route protection.
*   **2.2 API Routes Update**: Integrated Better-auth session management into the dedicated API service.
*   **2.3 Frontend Auth Components**: Updated UI for Better-auth client, which now communicates with the API service.

### PHASE 3: External API Clients & Data Aggregation (Status: ‚è≥ LATER)

**Goal**: Fetch, normalize, and prepare data from external sources for persistence and MVP use.

*   **3.1 External API Client Implementation**: AviationStack, FlightAware, OpenSky, Weather.
*   **3.2 Flight Data Aggregator (Initial)**: Normalization to `CanonicalFlightDataModel`, basic data flow to `historical_flight_segments`.
*   **3.3 Weather Data Aggregator/Client (Initial)**: Normalization to `CanonicalWeatherObservationModel`, basic data flow to `historical_weather_observations`.

### PHASE 4: Blockchain & Escrow Logic (Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Integrate PayGo and establish core escrow management for the MVP.

*   **4.1 PayGo Adapter**: (Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED) Integrated PayGo client, utilizing `EscrowIdPair` from generator.
*   **4.2 Escrow Manager**: (Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED) Developed and tested logic for all core escrow operations (create, fulfill, release), with API endpoints fully implemented.

### PHASE 5: Business Logic Engines (Status: ‚è≥ LATER)

**Goal**: Implement core insurance logic using internal and live data.

*   **5.1 Quote Engine**: Query internal historical data, then live data.
*   **5.2 Policy Engine**: Create policies, integrate with Escrow Manager.
*   **5.3 Payout Engine**: Monitor flights, process payouts.

### PHASE 6: API Layer Completion (Status: üéØ FINALIZING)

**Goal**: Expose all MVP functionality via secure APIs and connect the UI.

*   **6.1 Finalize Public API Endpoints**:
    *   [x] Implement system health endpoints (`/api/v1/health/*`).
    *   [ ] Implement the final `policy/purchase` endpoint.
*   **6.2 Connect UI to APIs**:
    *   [x] Replaced `test-auth` with the comprehensive `dev-dashboard`.
    *   [x] Connected all dashboard components to live APIs.

### PHASE 7: Frontend Implementation (Status: ‚è≥ LATER)

*   **7.1 Implement MVP User Flows**: Quote search, quote display, policy purchase, user dashboard.

### PHASE 8: Provider Foundation (InsureCo) & Testing (Status: ‚è≥ LATER)
