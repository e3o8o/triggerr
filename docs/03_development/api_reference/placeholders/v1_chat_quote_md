# API Placeholder: Chat Quote API

## Original Path
`/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/chat/quote/route.ts`

## Purpose
This API is designed to handle chat-based insurance quote requests. It processes natural language messages from users, extracts flight details, and returns insurance quote options based on the extracted information.

## Current Status
- **Status**: Disabled (Placeholder)
- **Build Status**: Failing in CI
- **Priority**: Medium

## Issues Encountered
- Build failure with error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'optional')`
- Schema validation issues with Zod
- Complex dependencies between API contracts and validation schemas
- Incomplete implementation of flight info extraction

## Required Dependencies
- `@insureinnie/core/auth`
- `@insureinnie/core/database/edge`
- `@insureinnie/core/database/schema`
- `@insureinnie/api-contracts`
- `@insureinnie/api-contracts/validators/chat`
- `@insureinnie/api-contracts/validators/insurance`
- `@insureinnie/api-contracts/dtos/chat`
- `@insureinnie/api-contracts/dtos/insurance`

## Implementation Plan
1. Create simplified schema validation that won't break the build
2. Implement proper flight info extraction from natural language
3. Connect to actual quote generation service
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Implement caching for similar quote requests

## Original Code
The original code has been preserved in this document. Key sections include:
- Chat message validation using `chatMessageRequestSchema`
- Flight info extraction from messages
- Quote request validation using `insuranceQuoteRequestSchema`
- Risk factor calculation and premium adjustment
- Quote generation and response formatting

## Notes
- The API needs to handle both authenticated and anonymous users
- Flight details extraction needs improvement with NLP techniques
- Consider adding a rate limiter for this endpoint
- Need to implement proper logging for debugging
