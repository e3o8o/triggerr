# ïnsureinnie Escrow Models (v2 - Improved)

*Last Updated: June 3, 2025*

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the refined escrow models for ïnsureinnie’s parametric flight delay insurance platform. Our goal is a decentralized marketplace leveraging blockchain smart contracts (PayGo) and reliable data (Aviationstack API) to automate payouts. These models balance **user experience (UX)**, **capital efficiency**, and **innovation** for diverse users (individuals, businesses, families).

Models are categorized by complexity and approach, guiding a phased implementation. The test suite (`cline.test.js`, `dappLabs.test.js`, etc.) validates these with realistic premiums ($25.50–$185.75) and coverage ($700–$8500).

### 1.1. Core Objectives
- **UX**: Simple, transparent, and fast interactions.
- **Capital Efficiency**: Minimize locked capital for scalability.
- **Innovation**: Explore novel blockchain and DeFi solutions.
- **Trustlessness**: Reduce reliance on provider solvency.
- **Scalability**: Support high-volume policies.

### 1.2. Common Fee Structure
Unless otherwise specified, the following platform fee structure applies. These fees are collected by ïnsureinnie and are independent of the provider's chosen premium return policy (see section 1.3):
- **Platform Premium Fee**: 12% of the user's premium, deducted at the time of policy purchase (e.g., $3.60 on a $30 premium).
- **Platform Escrow Fee**: 2% of the coverage amount, charged upon successful payout to the user or release of funds to the provider (e.g., $10 on $500 coverage).
- **Transaction Fee**: Standard blockchain gas fees (e.g., $0.0025 on Polygon), paid by the transacting party.

### 1.3. Premium Return Policy
Providers on the ïnsureinnie platform have the flexibility to define whether the user's premium is returned upon a successful claim. This is a configurable option at the provider or product level.
- **Default Policy (Provider Keeps Premium)**: Upon a successful claim, the user receives the payout amount, and the original premium is retained by the provider (after platform fees).
- **Optional Policy (Return Premium to Customer)**: Upon a successful claim, the user receives both the payout amount and a return of their original premium (after platform fees).

The choice of premium return policy can affect the total amount received by the user and the provider's net revenue per policy. The platform fees (Premium Fee and Escrow Fee) are charged consistently regardless of this provider-specific setting.

### 1.4. Escrow Identification Strategy

All escrow records, regardless of the specific `EscrowModelType` employed, will utilize a standardized identification system within the ïnsureinnie platform:

-   **`internalTraceableId`**: A human-readable, structured identifier generated by the platform (e.g., `ESC-INS-PROVIDER_SHORT-POLICYID-TIMESTAMP-RANDOM` for policy-related escrows, or `ESC-USR-USERID_SHORT-PURPOSE-TIMESTAMP-RANDOM` for generic user escrows). This ID is primarily for off-chain tracking, database relations, and administrative purposes.
-   **`blockchainIdentifier`**: The identifier used for interactions with the on-chain PayGo smart contracts. For policy-related escrows, this is typically a hash of the `internalTraceableId` to maintain a link while obfuscating internal structures. For generic user escrows or other types, it might be a secure random identifier (e.g., a 32-byte hex string).

This dual ID approach ensures clear internal traceability while allowing flexibility and security for on-chain operations. The specific `EscrowModelType` (e.g., `SingleSided`, `CollateralizedProviderPool`) will dictate the logic and participants of the escrow, but the core identification mechanism remains consistent.

## 2. Escrow Model Categories

We've grouped models into three main categories based on their mechanics and complexity:

1.  **Basic Escrow Models**: Simple, direct fund handling.
2.  **Pooled Escrow Models**: Shared capital pools for efficiency.
3.  **Advanced & Innovative Models**: Leveraging DeFi, NFTs, and novel structures.

### 2.1. Prisma Enum for Escrow Models

The following `EscrowModelType` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma` will be updated to reflect a more consolidated list:

```prisma
enum EscrowModelType {
  // Basic Models
  SingleSided                // User premium only in escrow
  DualSided                  // User premium and provider coverage in separate escrows
  Combined                   // User premium and provider coverage in a single escrow
  HybridPartialCollateral    // User premium + partial provider collateral in escrow

  // Pooled Models
  CollateralizedProviderPool // Provider maintains a single, on-chain collateralized pool
  BondedLiabilityPool        // Collateralized pool with third-party audits
  PeerToPeerPool             // Users and investors pool funds
  SubscriptionBasedPool      // Users pay recurring fees to a central pool

  // Advanced & Innovative Models
  DynamicRiskPool            // Pool collateral adjusted by AI based on real-time risk
  PredictionMarket           // Policies become prediction markets
  SyntheticDeFiCoverage      // Uses DeFi protocols for synthetic assets/CDPs
  NFTPolicy                  // Policy minted as a tradable NFT
  DAOGovernedPool            // P2P or Collateralized Pool governed by a DAO
}
```

## 3. Detailed Model Descriptions

### Category 1: Basic Escrow Models

These models involve straightforward escrow mechanisms, typically on a per-policy basis.

```

#### 3.1. Single-Sided Escrow
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Low
- **Mechanism**:
    - User pays premium into an escrow smart contract.
    - Provider maintains a general reserve fund (off-chain or separate on-chain pool) for payouts.
    - **On-Time**: Escrow releases premium to provider.
    - **Delayed**:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: Escrowed premium is released to the provider. User receives coverage only.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: Escrowed premium is released to the user. User receives coverage + premium.
- **Pros**: High capital efficiency (no per-policy provider capital locked in *this* escrow), simple flow.
- **Cons**: High trust in provider's reserve solvency, less transparency if reserves are off-chain.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Innovation**: Low | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: Low
- **Example**: Alice's $50 premium for $1000 coverage.
    - **On-Time**: Provider gets $50 from escrow.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: User receives $1000 (coverage) + $50 (premium) from the provider's reserves.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: User receives $1000 (coverage) from the provider's reserves; provider gets $50 from escrow.
- **Test Suite**: `cline.test.js` (Cline’s $35.99 premium).

#### 3.2. Dual-Sided Escrow
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Medium
- **Mechanism**:
    - User pays premium into one escrow.
    - Provider deposits full coverage amount into a *separate* escrow.
    - **On-Time**: Premium to provider, coverage returned to provider.
    - **Delayed**:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: Escrow A (premium) and Escrow B (coverage) are released to the user.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: Escrow A (premium) is released to the provider; Escrow B (coverage) is released to the user.
- **Pros**: Fully trustless (coverage locked), transparent.
- **Cons**: Very low capital efficiency (full coverage locked per policy), higher gas for two escrows.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐☆☆☆☆ | **Innovation**: Medium | **Scalability**: Low | **Reg. Risk**: Low
- **Example**: Michael's $89.99 premium; AeroProtect locks $3000 in Escrow B.
    - **On-Time**: Michael's premium (Escrow A) to provider; AeroProtect's collateral (Escrow B) back to provider.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: Michael gets $3089.99 (premium + coverage).
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: Michael gets $3000 (coverage); AeroProtect gets $89.99 (premium).
- **Test Suite**: `cline.test.js` (Cline’s $35.99 premium).

#### 3.3. Combined Escrow
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Medium
- **Mechanism**:
    - User pays premium and provider deposits full coverage into a *single* escrow.
    - **On-Time**: All funds (premium + coverage) to provider.
    - **Delayed**:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: All escrowed funds (user premium + provider coverage) are released to the user.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The coverage portion of escrowed funds is released to the user; the premium portion is released to the provider.
- **Pros**: Trustless, simpler than Dual-Sided (one escrow), transparent.
- **Cons**: Very low capital efficiency (full coverage locked).
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐☆☆☆☆ | **Innovation**: Medium | **Scalability**: Low | **Reg. Risk**: Low
- **Example**: Lee family's $96.90 premium; TravelGuard adds $2800. Total $2896.90 in one escrow.
    - **On-Time**: All $2896.90 to TravelGuard.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: Lee family gets $2896.90.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: Lee family gets $2800 (coverage); TravelGuard gets $96.90 (premium).
- **Test Suite**: `wongFamily.test.js` (can be adapted).

#### 3.4. Hybrid Partial Collateral Escrow (Timed-Release Hybrid)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Medium
- **Mechanism**:
    - User pays premium into escrow.
    - Provider adds a partial “proof of solvency” amount (e.g., 20% of coverage) to the same escrow.
    - **On-Time**: All escrowed funds to provider.
    - **Delayed**:
        - Provider sends the remaining portion of the coverage separately from their reserves.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: All escrowed funds (user premium + partial provider collateral) are released to the user.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The partial provider collateral from escrow is released to the user; the user premium from escrow is released to the provider.
- **Pros**: Balances trust and efficiency, more capital efficient than full escrows.
- **Cons**: Two-step payout for delays can be complex for UX, still relies on provider reserves for full amount.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | **Innovation**: High | **Scalability**: Medium | **Reg. Risk**: Low
- **Example**: David's $75 premium; provider adds $250 (for $1000 coverage). Escrow holds $325.
    - **On-Time**: All $325 to provider.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: David gets $325 from escrow + $750 from provider (total $1075).
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: David gets $250 from escrow (provider's partial collateral) + $750 from provider (total $1000 coverage); provider gets $75 (premium) from escrow.
- **Test Suite**: `alex.test.js`.

### Category 2: Pooled Escrow Models

These models utilize shared capital pools to improve capital efficiency and scalability.

```mermaid
graph TD
    U1[User 1 Premium] --> POOL[Shared Capital Pool];
    U2[User 2 Premium] --> POOL;
    UN[User N Premium] --> POOL;
    P[Provider Collateral/Contributions] --> POOL;
    INV[Investor Contributions (Optional)] --> POOL;
    POOL -- Flight Delayed (User X) --> UX[Payout to User X];
    POOL -- Flight On-Time (Profits) --> DIST{Profit Distribution};
    DIST --> P;
    DIST --> INV;
```

#### 3.5. Collateralized Provider Pool
- **Implementation Difficulty**: High
- **Mechanism**:
    - User premiums are paid into a main fund or directly to the provider.
    - Provider maintains a single, on-chain collateralized pool (e.g., holding 150% of total active policy liabilities).
    - Pool balance and collateralization ratio are publicly verifiable.
    - **On-Time**: Premium retained by provider.
    - **Delayed**: Payouts (coverage amount) are made from the collateralized pool. The original premium's treatment depends on the policy:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The premium amount (which was part of the pool's/provider's funds) is also paid out to the user from the pool.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The premium amount is effectively retained by the provider within the pool's overall accounting.
- **Pros**: Capital efficient (pooled collateral), transparent, scalable.
- **Cons**: Relies on provider maintaining pool solvency, complex pool management.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: Medium | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: Medium
- **Example**: Emma’s $35.99 premium for $1000 coverage. Provider maintains a $1.5M pool.
    - **On-Time**: Premium is retained by the provider (within the pool's accounting).
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: Emma receives $1000 (coverage) + $35.99 (premium) from the pool.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: Emma receives $1000 (coverage) from the pool; provider retains $35.99.
- **Test Suite**: `flightCancelled.test.js` (adapted for pool payout).

#### 3.6. Bonded Liability Pool (Audited Pool)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: High
- **Mechanism**:
    - Similar to Collateralized Pool, but with an emphasis on third-party audits (e.g., via Chainlink oracles) of the pool's solvency and liability coverage.
    - Provider maintains a bonded pool (e.g., covering 50-100% of total liabilities).
    - **On-Time**: Premium to provider.
    - **Delayed**: Payouts (coverage amount) are made from the bonded liability pool. The premium (held in the separate escrow) is released based on the policy:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: Premium in escrow is released to the user.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: Premium in escrow is released to the provider.
- **Pros**: Highly capital efficient, increased trust due to audits, very scalable.
- **Cons**: Reliance on auditor/oracle integrity, complex setup for audit integration.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Innovation**: High | **Scalability**: Very High | **Reg. Risk**: Medium
- **Example**: GlobalCorp's $155.99 premium for $7000 coverage. Provider's $10M bonded pool is audited quarterly.
    - **On-Time**: Premium in escrow released to provider.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: User receives $7000 from bonded pool + $155.99 from premium escrow.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: User receives $7000 from bonded pool; provider receives $155.99 from premium escrow.
- **Test Suite**: `globalCorp.test.js`.

#### 3.7. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Escrow Pool
- **Implementation Difficulty**: High
- **Mechanism**:
    - Users pool premiums into a shared smart contract.
    - External investors can contribute additional capital to the pool, earning a share of premiums/profits if flights are on-time.
    - **Delayed**: Affected users receive coverage (payout amount) from the pool. The original premium's treatment depends on the policy defined by the P2P pool's rules:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The premium amount is also returned to the user from the pool.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The premium amount is retained within the pool, potentially benefiting liquidity providers or as per the pool's profit/loss distribution.
    - **On-Time**: Pool funds (premiums + investor capital not paid out) are distributed among contributors (investors, provider, platform) based on a predefined formula.
- **Pros**: Leverages community capital, can be highly capital efficient for the platform, innovative.
- **Cons**: Liquidity risk if contributions are low, complex UX for participants, complex fund allocation logic.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: High | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: High
- **Example**: FrequentFlyerDAO uses a P2P pool. Members contribute liquidity. User pays $25 premium for $500 coverage.
    - **On-Time**: Premium contributes to the pool, potentially rewarding liquidity providers.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: User receives $500 (coverage) + $25 (premium) from the pool.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: User receives $500 (coverage) from the pool; the $25 premium is retained within the pool's ecosystem.
- **Test Suite**: `dappLabs.test.js`.

#### 3.8. Subscription-Based Pool
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High
- **Mechanism**:
    - Users pay a recurring subscription fee (e.g., monthly) for flight insurance coverage (potentially for multiple flights or a set value).
    - Subscription fees fund a central payout pool, possibly structured as a Bonded or Collateralized Pool.
    - Per-flight activation might involve a nominal fee or just registration.
    - **Delayed**: Payouts (coverage amount) are made from the subscription-funded pool. The concept of 'premium return' per covered event is less direct here, as the user pays a subscription. However, if a per-event fee was also charged:
        - **If Premium Return Policy (for per-event fee) = Return to Customer**: The per-event fee could be returned to the user along with coverage.
        - **If Premium Return Policy (for per-event fee) = Provider Keeps Fee (Default)**: The per-event fee is retained by the pool/provider.
- **Pros**: Predictable revenue for platform, simplified UX for frequent flyers, potentially high capital efficiency if pool is well-managed.
- **Cons**: Complex to price subscriptions accurately, adoption risk (targets frequent travelers), pool management overhead.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: High | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: Medium
- **Example**: AeroClub members pay $50/month. Each flight covered up to $300. Optional: a nominal $5 per-event activation fee.
    - **On-Time**: Subscription fee contributes to pool. Any per-event fee is retained by pool/provider.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium - if per-event fee applies and is set to return)**: User receives $300 (coverage) + $5 (per-event fee) from the pool.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium - if per-event fee applies and is set to be kept)**: User receives $300 (coverage) from the pool; the $5 per-event fee is retained.

### Category 3: Advanced & Innovative Models

These models incorporate more complex technologies like DeFi, NFTs, prediction markets, and DAOs.

#### 3.9. Dynamic Risk Pool (AI-Adjusted Collateral)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High
- **Mechanism**:
    - A type of Collateralized or Bonded Pool where the required collateralization ratio is dynamically adjusted based on real-time risk assessment (e.g., using AI to analyze flight routes, weather, airline history).
    - Higher risk periods/flights demand higher collateral in the pool.
    - **On-Time**: Premium is retained by the provider (within the pool's accounting).
    - **Delayed**: Payouts (coverage amount) are made from the dynamic risk pool. The original premium's treatment depends on the policy:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The premium amount (which was part of the pool's/provider's funds) is also paid out to the user from the pool.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The premium amount is effectively retained by the provider within the pool's overall accounting.
- **Pros**: Optimizes capital efficiency by matching collateral to current risk, innovative.
- **Cons**: Complex AI/risk modeling required, oracle reliance for data feeds, potential for model error.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: Very High | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: Medium
- **Example**: User pays $40 premium for $800 coverage. AI assesses risk and adjusts pool collateral.
    - **On-Time**: Premium retained by provider (in pool accounting).
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: User receives $800 (coverage) + $40 (premium) from the pool.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: User receives $800 (coverage) from the pool; provider retains $40.

#### 3.10. Prediction Market Model
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High
- **Mechanism**:
    - Each policy (or groups of similar policies) effectively becomes a prediction market.
    - Users' premiums help fund one side of the market (e.g., betting on delay).
    - External speculators/investors fund the other side (betting on no-delay), providing the capital for potential payouts.
    - The platform or provider might act as a market maker.
    - **Delayed**: Payout from market funds supplied by 'no-delay' bettors/speculators. The user receives the coverage amount. The premium's treatment depends on the market rules and the provider's policy:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The user's initial premium (stake) is returned to them in addition to the coverage.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The user's initial premium is won by the 'no-delay' bettors/speculators or the market maker.
    - **On-Time**: 'No-delay' bettors/speculators win, typically sharing the user's premium (their stake) or as per market rules.
- **Pros**: Market-driven price discovery, potentially very capital efficient for platform, highly innovative.
- **Cons**: Extremely complex to implement and manage, high liquidity risk, challenging UX for average users, very high regulatory risk (gambling concerns).
- **UX**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Innovation**: Very High | **Scalability**: Low (due to liquidity) | **Reg. Risk**: Very High
- **Example**: Policy for $1000 coverage, user pays $50 premium (stake).
    - **On-Time**: 'No-delay' bettors win the $50 stake (less any market fees).
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: User receives $1000 (coverage) + $50 (premium returned).
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: User receives $1000 (coverage); the $50 premium is won by 'no-delay' side.

#### 3.11. Synthetic DeFi Coverage
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High
- **Mechanism**:
    - User pays premium.
    - Provider uses DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave, MakerDAO, Synthetix) to create synthetic assets or collateralized debt positions (CDPs) that represent the coverage obligation.
    - Yield generated from these positions can be used to offset costs or enhance payouts.
    - **On-Time**: Yield generated from premium is distributed (e.g., to provider, platform, or back to user as a rebate, depending on specific model). Original premium might be locked or returned based on DeFi protocol rules.
    - **Delayed**: User is paid the coverage amount. This payout might come from generated yield, the principal premium, or a separate reserve. The premium's treatment depends on the provider's policy and DeFi protocol specifics:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The original premium (or its equivalent value if it was staked/invested) is returned to the user in addition to the coverage. This might mean unwinding a DeFi position.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The original premium (or its value/yield) is retained by the provider/platform, or as per the DeFi protocol's profit/loss handling.
- **Pros**: Leverages DeFi for capital efficiency and trustlessness (if designed well), highly innovative.
- **Cons**: High complexity (DeFi integration), exposure to DeFi risks (smart contract bugs, oracle failures, volatility), challenging UX.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: Very High | **Scalability**: High | **Reg. Risk**: High

#### 3.12. NFT-Policy (Tradable Policy)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: High
- **Mechanism**:
    - Each insurance policy is minted as a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
    - The NFT contains metadata about the policy (flight, coverage, premium, status).
    - The NFT itself can be held in an escrow contract, or its ownership can trigger claims against a reserve pool or one of the other escrow models (e.g., Single-Sided, Hybrid).
    - NFTs can be traded on secondary marketplaces.
    - **On-Time**: If the policy was tied to an escrow holding the premium (or if the NFT sale price implicitly included it), this amount might be released to the seller/provider. If the NFT is just a claim right, no specific action beyond the policy expiring.
    - **Delayed**: The current NFT holder at the time of the event (or verification) is eligible for payout. The payout mechanism (including premium return) would follow the rules of the underlying escrow model linked to the NFT, or a specific NFT-based claim contract.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer (NFT Holder)**: The NFT holder receives the coverage amount plus the original premium value.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The NFT holder receives the coverage amount, and the original premium value is retained by the provider/platform.
- **Pros**: Adds liquidity and tradability to policies, innovative, potential for new UX paradigms.
- **Cons**: Adds complexity (NFT minting/management), gas costs for NFT transactions, UX challenges for non-crypto users, regulatory uncertainty for tradable insurance policies.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (depends on underlying escrow) | **Innovation**: Very High | **Scalability**: Medium | **Reg. Risk**: High
- **Example**: User pays $60 premium for $1200 coverage, minted as an NFT. They can sell it on OpenSea.
    - **On-Time**: Policy expires. If premium was escrowed with NFT, it's released to provider.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer)**: Current NFT holder claims and receives $1200 (coverage) + $60 (original premium value).
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium)**: Current NFT holder claims and receives $1200 (coverage); original premium value retained by provider.
- **Test Suite**: `alex.test.js` (can be adapted for NFT).

#### 3.13. DAO-Governed Pool
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High
- **Mechanism**:
    - A P2P or Collateralized Pool where governance (e.g., setting fees, collateral ratios, dispute resolution, profit sharing rules, and specifics of premium return handling) is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) through token-based voting ($INNI tokens).
    - **On-Time**: Premium handling follows the underlying pool logic (e.g., retained by pool/provider, distributed to LPs), as potentially modified by DAO rules.
    - **Delayed**: Payouts (coverage amount) are made from the DAO-governed pool. The original premium's treatment depends on the policy configured by the provider and ratified or defined by the DAO:
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Return to Customer**: The premium amount is also returned to the user from the pool, subject to DAO treasury/pool rules.
        - **If Premium Return Policy = Provider Keeps Premium (Default)**: The premium amount is retained within the pool system, its allocation (e.g., to LPs, DAO treasury, provider) governed by DAO rules.
- **Pros**: Decentralized governance, community engagement, transparency.
- **Cons**: Complex governance mechanics, potential for slow decision-making or voter apathy, high regulatory risk for DAOs.
- **UX**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | **Capital Eff.**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | **Innovation**: Very High | **Scalability**: Medium | **Reg. Risk**: Very High
- **Example**: A community-governed travel protection DAO. User pays $30 premium for $700 coverage.
    - **On-Time**: Premium retained in DAO pool, potentially rewarding LPs as per DAO rules.
    - **Delayed (Return Premium to Customer, as per DAO policy)**: User receives $700 (coverage) + $30 (premium) from the DAO pool.
    - **Delayed (Provider Keeps Premium, as per DAO policy)**: User receives $700 (coverage) from DAO pool; premium retained in pool.

#### 3.14. Multi-Oracle Verified Payout
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Very High (if building custom consensus)
- **Mechanism**:
    - **Nature**: This is an enhancement applicable to any escrow model, not a standalone escrow model itself.
    - **Mechanism**: Utilizes multiple independent oracles (e.g., Chainlink nodes, each sourcing data from different flight APIs like Aviationstack, FlightStats, Amadeus, etc.) to verify claim events (e.g., flight delay duration, cancellation).
    - A consensus mechanism (e.g., 2 out of 3 agreement, median value) determines the event outcome, triggering the payout logic of the underlying escrow model.
    - **Impact on Premium Return Policy**: This model ensures the *conditions* for payout (and thus for applying the premium return policy of the base escrow model) are verified with high reliability. It doesn't define the premium return policy itself, but rather validates the event that triggers it.
    - **On-Time / Delayed**: The multi-oracle system determines if the event was 'On-Time' or 'Delayed'. The underlying escrow model then handles the premium and coverage payout according to its defined premium return policy.
- **Pros**: Significantly increased trust, reliability, and resilience of payout triggers by reducing reliance on a single data source and mitigating risks of API failure or data manipulation. Aligns with multi-provider API strategy.
- **Cons**: Increased complexity in implementation (managing multiple data feeds, consensus logic) and potentially higher operational costs (multiple oracle/API fees).
- **UX**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (as it leads to fairer and more trusted outcomes) | **Capital Eff.**: N/A (enhancement) | **Innovation**: High | **Scalability**: N/A (enhancement, but improves scalability of trust) | **Reg. Risk**: Medium (as it demonstrates robustness)
- **Example**: A Single-Sided Escrow policy uses multi-oracle verification. Three oracles query Aviationstack, FlightStats, and a direct airline API. If 2 of 3 confirm a 3-hour delay:
    - The 'Delayed' event is confirmed.
    - If the Single-Sided Escrow policy had 'Return Premium to Customer', the user gets coverage + premium.
    - If it was 'Provider Keeps Premium', the user gets coverage, provider gets premium from escrow.
