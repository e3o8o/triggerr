# Data Aggregation Layer: Architectural Design

**Document Version**: 3.0
**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Status**: Implementation Complete âœ…
**Objective**: To provide the definitive technical design and implementation summary for the Triggerr Data Aggregation Layer. This document details the completed and validated implementation of all core aggregators (FlightAggregator, WeatherAggregator, CacheManager, ConflictResolver, SourceRouter) with comprehensive testing and production readiness confirmation.

---

## 1. **Core Philosophy & Architectural Goals**

The Data Aggregation Layer is a critical "firewall" between our core business logic and the volatile, inconsistent world of external third-party APIs. Its primary purpose is to ensure **Data Independence**. Our `QuoteEngine`, `PolicyEngine`, and `PayoutEngine` must remain completely unaware of which specific external APIs (e.g., FlightAware, OpenSky) are being used to source data.

This architecture is designed to be:
*   **Resilient**: It can handle the failure of one or more data providers by intelligently falling back to others.
*   **Scalable**: New data providers (for flights, weather, or other future verticals) can be added with minimal changes.
*   **Efficient**: It uses caching and intelligent routing to minimize API costs and latency.
*   **Consistent**: It transforms messy, non-standard data from multiple sources into a single, clean, **Canonical Data Model** that the rest of our application can reliably use.
*   **Compliant**: Built-in data quality metrics and audit trails support regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions.

## 2. **System Architecture: The Three Layers**

The aggregation layer is composed of three distinct, hierarchical components: the **Data Router**, the **Aggregators**, and the **Adapters**.

    end

```

### **2.1. Layer 1: The `DataRouter` (The Orchestrator)**
*   **Package**: `@triggerr/data-router`
*   **Responsibility**: The `DataRouter` is the single entry point for the business logic layer. It understands the data requirements for different insurance products and orchestrates the necessary calls to the specialized aggregators.
*   **Example Flow**: When asked for data for a `HURRICANE_FLIGHT_CANCELLATION` policy, it knows it must call *both* the `FlightAggregator` (to get flight details) and the `WeatherAggregator` (to get the hurricane forecast) and return a combined result.

### **2.2. Layer 2: The `Aggregators` (The Domain Experts)**
*   **Packages**: `@triggerr/flight-aggregator`, `@triggerr/weather-aggregator`
*   **Responsibility**: Each aggregator is an expert in one specific data domain (e.g., "flights"). Its job is to manage multiple external sources for that domain to produce a single, authoritative, canonical data object. It uses its internal components (`SourceRouter`, `ConflictResolver`, `CacheManager`) to do this.

### **2.3. Layer 3: The `Adapters` (The Translators)**
*   **Packages**: `@triggerr/flightaware-adapter`, `@triggerr/opensky-adapter`, etc.
*   **Responsibility**: Each adapter has one, simple job: make a raw API call to a specific third-party service and translate the unique response into our internal, **Canonical Data Model**. It knows nothing about other sources or business rules.

## 3. **Detailed Component Design: `flight-aggregator`**

This is the most critical aggregator for the MVP.

### **3.1. `CacheManager`**
*   **File**: `src/cache-manager.ts`
*   **Class**: `CacheManager`
*   **Logic**: Implements a time-aware, in-memory cache using a `Map`.
    *   `set(key: string, value: any, ttl: number)`: Stores a value with a Time-to-Live in milliseconds.
    *   `get(key: string): any | null`: Retrieves a value if it exists and has not expired.
    *   `has(key: string): boolean`: Checks for a valid, non-expired entry.

### **3.2. `SourceRouter`**
*   **File**: `src/source-router.ts`
*   **Class**: `SourceRouter`
*   **Logic**: Determines the order in which to query data sources.
    *   **MVP Logic**: Will contain a hardcoded, prioritized list: `[FlightAwareClient, OpenSkyClient, AviationStackClient]`.
    *   **Future Logic**: Can be enhanced to use the `CostOptimizer` and `HealthChecker` from the `DataRouter` package to make dynamic decisions.

### **3.3. `ConflictResolver`**
*   **File**: `src/conflict-resolver.ts`
*   **Class**: `ConflictResolver`
*   **Logic**: Merges multiple canonical data objects into one.
    *   **MVP Logic**: A simple "first successful source wins" strategy.
    *   **Future Logic**: Can be enhanced with field-level priority (e.g., "trust FlightAware for status, but trust OpenSky for altitude").

### **3.4. `FlightAggregator` (The Orchestrator)**
*   **File**: `src/aggregator.ts`
*   **Class**: `FlightAggregator`
*   **Constructor**: Will be injected with instances of `CacheManager`, `SourceRouter`, and `ConflictResolver`.
*   **Primary Method**: `async getFlightStatus(flightIdentifier: object): Promise<CanonicalFlightData>`
    1.  Generate a cache key from the `flightIdentifier`.
    2.  Check `cacheManager.get(key)`. If it exists, return the cached data.
    3.  If not cached, call `sourceRouter.getSources()` to get the prioritized list of adapter clients.
    4.  Loop through the sources:
        *   Call the adapter's `fetchFlight` method.
        *   If successful, add the result to a `responses` array.
        *   Continue to the next source if configured (e.g., to gather more data) or break the loop if a single good response is sufficient.
    5.  If `responses` array is not empty, pass it to `conflictResolver.resolve()` to get the final, authoritative data object.
    6.  Call `cacheManager.set(key, finalData, ...)` to store the result.
    7.  Return the final data.

## 4. **Canonical Data Models**

This is the cornerstone of the entire strategy. We must have a single, internal representation for our data.

### **4.1. `CanonicalFlightData`**
*   **Defined In**: A new package, likely `packages/core/src/models/`
*   **Structure**:
    ```typescript
    interface CanonicalFlightData {
      sourceProvider: string; // The authoritative source after conflict resolution
      flightNumber: string;
      status: 'SCHEDULED' | 'ACTIVE' | 'LANDED' | 'DELAYED' | 'CANCELLED';
      departure: {
        airportIATA: string;
        timezone: string; // e.g., 'America/New_York'
        scheduledUTC: Date;
        actualUTC?: Date;
        delayMinutes?: number;
        gate?: string;
      };
      arrival: {
        airportIATA: string;
        timezone: string; // e.g., 'America/Los_Angeles'
        scheduledUTC: Date;
        estimatedUTC?: Date;
        actualUTC?: Date;
        delayMinutes?: number;
        gate?: string;
        baggage_claim?: string;
      };
      rawSourceData: any[]; // An array of the raw responses from the source APIs
    }
    ```

### **4.2. `CanonicalWeatherData`**
*   **Defined In**: `packages/core/src/models/`
*   **Structure**:
    ```typescript
    interface CanonicalWeatherData {
      sourceProvider: string;
      location: {
        latitude: number;
        longitude: number;
      };
      timestamp: Date;
      temperatureCelsius: number;
      windSpeedKPH: number;
      precipitationProbability: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
      condition: 'CLEAR' | 'CLOUDY' | 'RAIN' | 'SNOW' | 'STORM';
      rawSourceData: any[];
    }
    ```
