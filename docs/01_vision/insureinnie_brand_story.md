# The triggerr Brand Story

## Origin: The Departure Gate Revelation

**Sarah Chen** was stuck at JFK, watching her flight to Tokyo get delayed for the third time. Around her, frustrated travelers were frantically calling insurance companies, filling out forms, taking photos of departure boards, and arguing with customer service about coverage that might—*might*—reimburse them weeks later.

But Sarah wasn't just any traveler. As a smart contract developer, she saw something different in that chaos: a perfect use case for automation.

*"What if insurance just... worked?"* she thought, watching the departure board flip to another delay. *"What if it activated automatically when bad things happened, like switching between work and personal modes, but for protection?"*

## The "Innie" Insight

The name came from Sarah's obsession with Severance—that brilliant show about consciousness switching automatically between work and personal life. She realized that's exactly what insurance should do: seamlessly switch from "dormant" to "active" the moment you need it, without you having to remember, file, or fight for it.

**triggerr** was born from this idea: your "insurance innie" that lives inside the system, monitoring, waiting, ready to activate automatically when life throws you curveballs.

## The Philosophy: Invisible Until You Need It

Traditional insurance makes you work when you're already stressed. You're dealing with a flight delay, and now you have to *also* deal with insurance bureaucracy?

triggerr flips this completely:
- **Your "innie" is always watching** - monitoring flight data, weather patterns, event cancellations
- **Switches on automatically** - the moment a delay hits the threshold, payouts trigger
- **You stay focused on what matters** - rebooking flights, finding hotels, living your life

## The Mission: Making Insurance Disappear

We believe the best insurance is insurance you never have to think about. It should work like your phone's battery indicator—invisible until it's needed, then instantly there when you need it most.

**triggerr** isn't just parametric insurance. It's insurance that knows when to be your "innie"—working invisibly in the background—and when to surface with exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.

## The Promise: Your Invisible Safety Net

*"We're building the insurance experience you always wished existed: one that works harder than you do, thinks faster than you can, and pays out before you even realize you needed it."*

Every time someone gets an automatic payout notification while they're still figuring out their rebooking options, we've succeeded. Every time someone says "I forgot I even had this coverage," we've won.

**triggerr: The insurance that works so you don't have to.**
