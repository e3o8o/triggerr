## Executive Summary

The x402 protocol represents a revolutionary approach to programmatic payments that aligns perfectly with Triggerr's vision of an API-first, machine-to-machine payment ecosystem. This document outlines the comprehensive integration strategy for implementing x402 alongside our existing payment infrastructure to enable micropayments, AI agent compatibility, and frictionless B2B API monetization.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enable micropayments as low as $0.001 per API call
- Native support for AI agents and autonomous systems
- Reduced payment friction through stateless HTTP-based transactions
- Enhanced revenue opportunities through usage-based pricing
- Competitive differentiation in the insurance platform market

**Strategic Recommendation:** Proceed with phased integration starting Q2 2024, positioning x402 as a complementary payment method alongside existing Stripe and PayGo infrastructure.

## x402 Protocol Overview

### What is x402?

x402 is an open payment standard built around the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code, enabling services to charge for API access and content directly over HTTP. The protocol is designed for:

- **Machine-to-Machine Payments**: AI agents and automated systems
- **Micropayments**: Transactions as low as $0.001
- **Stateless Interactions**: No account management or session state
- **Crypto-Native Payments**: Blockchain-based settlement

### Core Components

1. **HTTP 402 Status Code**: Signals payment requirement
2. **Payment Payloads**: Signed transaction data
3. **Facilitator Services**: Verification and settlement infrastructure
4. **Wallet Integration**: Crypto wallet connectivity

### Protocol Flow
